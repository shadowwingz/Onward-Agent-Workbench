- Hard rule: **Never create git commits automatically.** Only commit when the user explicitly asks. This applies to all branches without exception.

For platform-related commands, always consider these three platforms:
1. macOS
2. Linux
3. Windows
- Use the development build for compilation and debugging by default (`pnpm dist:dev`), unless the user explicitly asks for a production build.
- After modifying code, trigger a build using the following command. Before building, you must fully delete the `out` and `release` directories; otherwise stale code may be packaged. `rm -rf` and `pnpm dist:dev` must be run in the same command joined with `&&`; do not run them separately.
    # Clean and package (development build)
    rm -rf out release && pnpm dist:dev

- After a successful `pnpm dist:dev`, the build script automatically opens the packaged app (macOS `open`, Windows `start`, Linux `xdg-open`) for a smoke test. Auto-launch is skipped when `CI` is truthy (set `ONWARD_DIST_DEV_OPEN=1` to force) or when `ONWARD_DIST_DEV_OPEN=0` is set. See `docs/debug-env-variables.md`.
    If the user explicitly asks for a production build:
    # Clean and package (production build)
    rm -rf out release && pnpm dist
- After every code change, you must perform a startup test and confirm at minimum that the application can launch normally and enter the main UI. When `pnpm dist:dev` auto-opens the packaged app, a clean launch counts as the startup test; if exact launch control is required, set `ONWARD_DIST_DEV_OPEN=0` and launch manually once.
- Hard rule — Launching the app for testing: before opening the built `.app`, you must first kill any existing instance of the same application using **exact name matching** (`pkill -x "<exact-process-name>"`). Never use wildcards or partial matches. Chain the kill and open in one command: `pkill -x "Under Development <version>-<branch>" 2>/dev/null; sleep 0.5; open "<path-to-.app>"`.
    - **Absolutely forbidden during testing**: broad patterns such as `pkill -9 "Under Development"`, `pkill "Under Development"`, `pkill -f "Under Development"`, `pkill "Under Development <version>-<branch> Helper"`, or any `pkill` invocation that resolves via substring/regex instead of the exact process name. Such commands also terminate the user's Claude Code session, other branch builds, unrelated helpers, and anything whose name merely contains the shared prefix. This applies even to the `-9` signal: SIGKILL does not excuse a loose selector.
    - The exact process name MUST be passed as the final argument with `-x` and nothing else. Helper processes (for example, `Under Development <version>-<branch> Helper`, `Under Development <version>-<branch> Helper (GPU)`, `Under Development <version>-<branch> Helper (Renderer)`) are cleaned up automatically by the OS once the parent main process exits — do NOT kill them yourself.
    - When in doubt, always run `pgrep -lx "<exact-name>"` first to confirm exactly which processes will be targeted, and only then run `pkill -x "<exact-name>"`. If `pgrep` returns nothing, there is nothing to kill.
- Multilingual / UI Copy Development Rules:
    - The application currently supports `en` and `zh-CN`, with English as the default language. Whenever user-visible copy is added or modified, all supported languages must be designed and implemented together. Updating only one language is not allowed.
    - User-visible copy includes, but is not limited to, page titles, buttons, settings items, menus, tray menus, dialogs, toasts, tooltips, placeholders, empty states, error messages, context menus, and status text.
    - Any new or modified UI copy must be integrated through the i18n module / dictionary and accessed by key. Do not continue hardcoding single-language strings inside components.
    - For multilingual changes that affect UI layout or interaction, you must also verify language-specific differences in text length, wrapping, truncation, alignment, button width, and dialog layout, to ensure every supported language remains usable and visually correct.
    - If a change affects language settings, persisted storage, main-process menus, the tray, system dialogs, or other non-renderer copy, you must also update the corresponding settings storage, main-process mappings, and fallback logic.
- When the user explicitly asks for automated testing after describing the task requirements:
    - You must create automated test scripts based on the user's requirements and code changes, and run them completely.
    - Ensure the functionality, new features, or bug fixes mentioned by the user are fully resolved.
    - Expand test cases from the requirements to cover different operation paths and entry points.
    - Add as complete a set of test cases as possible and run them all; only report completion after all tests pass.
    - Newly created test scripts must be stored under the `test` directory, and the relevant documentation must be updated for reuse.
    - Fixture files must live on disk, not inlined. Any binary or non-trivial fixture a test constructs — PDF, EPUB, images, sample source files, sample git repos — must be written as a real file under `test/` (or `test/fixtures/<suite>/`). Do NOT embed base64 blobs inside `.ts` / `.js` test sources. Rationale: fixtures are reusable across tests, regenerable from a builder script, diffable, and inspectable by opening them directly. Tests should copy the fixture into their working directory via a terminal command (`cp` on POSIX, `Copy-Item` on Windows) so the flow mirrors what a real user would see.
- Hard rule — Test fixture isolation: when running tests, construct a self-contained fixture set covering cases that range from simple to complex (including code structure and folder structure), materialize it under a dedicated test working directory, and use that directory as the test's `cwd`. Requirements:
    1. Never read from or operate against the user's real data. Do not target the user's Home directory, root directory, or any other path outside the project. In particular, do not pass `$HOME`, `~`, `/`, or other system-level paths as the test working directory.
    2. Tests must operate exclusively inside the dedicated test working directory you created for that suite.
    3. If the target test working directory does not exist on the user's machine, create it before the test runs.
    4. The test working directory must be committed as a reusable test asset under the `test/` directory (e.g. `test/fixtures/<suite-name>/`), so it ships with the repository and can be reused by future runs and by CI.
- Icon sizing guidelines
    - The macOS app icon must follow the safe-area proportions from Apple Design Resources to avoid appearing oversized in the Dock / Mission Control.
    - Use `resources/icon.svg` as the single source of truth. After changes, fully regenerate `resources/icons/**`, `icon.icns`, `icon.ico`, and `icon.png`.
    - When the app icon display size looks wrong, first check the content-to-canvas ratio rather than the resolution; add more padding by scaling down the content.
    - macOS status bar icons must follow the Template convention: the filename must contain `Template`, and the code must explicitly call `setTemplateImage(true)`; avoid incorrect colors in light/dark mode.
    - After generating tray icons, update all referenced paths so the resource filenames and code stay consistent.
- After the build completes, show the current status. For `pnpm dist:dev`, the script usually launches the packaged app automatically; if not (e.g. `ONWARD_DIST_DEV_OPEN=0`), provide the manual command, for example: `open "project-dir/release/mac-arm64/Under Development <version>-<branch>.app"` (macOS). The dev-build product name format is `Under Development <package.json version>-<branch>`, e.g. `Under Development 2.0.1-master`.
- Whenever `CLAUDE.md` is modified, automatically run `./claude-sync-to-agents.sh`.
- Git commit messages must be written in English.
- Hard rule: all code comments must use English. Do not use any Simplified Chinese in code comments.
- Do not manually edit generated Change Log HTML files under `resources/changelog/**` (including `resources/changelog/html/**`) when modifying code or fixing bugs. These HTML files are compiled artifacts; update the source Markdown / JSON and regenerate derived assets through the changelog scripts only when release or Change Log work explicitly requires it.
- Copyright and license compliance:
    - Never copy or adapt code from third-party projects, Stack Overflow, blog posts, or any other external source without verifying its license compatibility with Apache-2.0. Do not reproduce substantial code blocks whose origin is unclear. When in doubt, write an original implementation instead of reusing external snippets.
    - Generated code must not introduce any dependency or code snippet licensed under GPL, LGPL, AGPL, SSPL, or any other copyleft license incompatible with Apache-2.0.
    - Before adding a new production dependency, verify its license is Apache-2.0 compatible (MIT, BSD, ISC, Apache-2.0 are safe; MPL-2.0 requires review; GPL/LGPL/AGPL are forbidden).
    - Every new source file must include the standard SPDX header: `SPDX-FileCopyrightText: 2026 OPPO` and `SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0`.
    - After adding new dependencies, run `pnpm generate-notices` to regenerate `ThirdPartyNotices.txt` and verify no incompatible licenses were introduced.
- Debugging principles (performance / lag issues):
    - Analyze the current code and the user's requirements first, and prioritize a detailed automated test plan. The test plan must include:
        1. Common paths
        2. High-frequency operation paths
        3. Stress-test paths
    - Sample first, then add logs: use `sample` / profiling to locate hot functions first, then add logs to verify causality.
    - Lock down a reliably reproducible path and time window first: fix the path, steps, and timeline to ensure stable reproduction.
    - Standardize key counters: AppState updates, Git polling, render / DOMPurify counts, etc. They must be observable at a 1-second granularity.
    - Avoid weak stress tests: editing volume and switching frequency must be high enough to surface peak load.
    - Prioritize concurrency and reentrancy checks: determine whether polling, timers, or async tasks are stacking; add throttling / deduplication first.
    - Cleanup must be complete on close / switch: cancel pending worker, timer, idle, and raf tasks to prevent leftover work.
    - Keep the evidence chain closed: profiling, logs, and code must agree, with before / after comparison.
- Hard rule — Renderer scheduling and input responsiveness:
    - Before creating features, fixing bugs, or solving performance issues, consult `docs/Off-Renderer Threaded Design - Electron Refactor.md` to decide whether the implementation belongs on the Renderer thread or in an asynchronous Worker / main worker / utility process. This design decision is mandatory for any work that can affect input responsiveness, rendering cadence, AppState, terminal output, Git, search, file indexing, parsing, sanitization, serialization, or large-list processing.
    - The renderer must be treated primarily as the user input loop. Do not run terminal parsing, Git work, project search, DOM sanitization, large diff processing, or other expensive work directly on the renderer thread when it can be moved to the main process, a utility process, or a Worker Thread.
    - Use a multi-queue priority scheduler for renderer work. Separate at least Prompt input, focused Task input/output, visible Task output, hidden Task output, and background maintenance into independent queues so one queue cannot monopolize the renderer.
    - Terminal and Task refreshes must be batched. Do not flush every Task immediately on every data event. Prefer a fixed cadence such as 20 ms or a frame-budgeted equivalent, then coalesce all pending Task output for that batch.
    - Prompt input has the highest priority. When focus is inside the Prompt input area, input handling and paint must preempt terminal output, Git updates, search updates, AppState propagation, and background UI refresh.
    - A Task with keyboard focus, mouse focus, or active user interaction receives a temporary priority boost for its input/output lane. The boost must be time-bounded and must not starve Prompt input.
    - PTY output is not user focus. Background Task output must not continuously promote all Tasks to interactive priority; terminal GitWatch/status work must be coalesced per repository, deduplicated across terminals, and kept out of untracked-file enumeration unless the user explicitly opens a Git feature that needs it.
    - If Prompt input and focused Task output compete, Prompt input wins. This is the global priority rule for scheduling conflicts.
    - Hidden or non-visible Task output must not continuously cross IPC or call renderer write paths. Keep it buffered, summarized, or dropped according to the terminal output model until a visible consumer requests it.
    - All long-running or high-volume operations must have cancellation, deduplication, and cleanup on close / switch. Pending worker jobs, timers, idle callbacks, animation-frame callbacks, and IPC subscriptions must be cancelled when their owner view is no longer active.
    - Every renderer scheduling change must preserve an automated baseline comparison for Prompt input latency and multi-Task terminal pressure. Do not accept a performance refactor without before / after JSON results and threshold gates.
- Context menu rules: any action available through a context menu must include an SVG icon (`width="14" height="14" viewBox="0 0 16 16" fill="currentColor"`). The menu item structure must be `<svg> + <span>text</span>`, using `display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 8px` to keep all context menus visually consistent.
- Context menu icon registry is maintained in `docs/context-menu-icon-registry.md`. Consult it on demand before adding or changing any context menu action, rather than keeping the full registry inline in `CLAUDE.md`.
- Unified context menu CSS rules (all components must follow):
    - Container: `background: var(--panel); border-radius: 10px; padding: 6px; box-shadow: var(--shadow-1); animation: *-context-fade-in 0.15s ease`
    - Menu item: `border-radius: 6px; hover background: color-mix(in srgb, var(--accent) 15%, transparent)`
    - Danger item hover: `background: rgba(239, 68, 68, 0.15)`
    - Separator: `margin: 4px 6px`
- Development principle: any subpage entered from the terminal entry point (such as Git Diff, Git History, or the Project Editor) must respond to ESC consistently and return to the terminal. Prefer reusing a shared ESC handling mechanism (for example, a common Hook) to avoid inconsistent implementations across pages.
- Process management safety: when killing or searching for processes (e.g., `taskkill`, `Get-Process`, `pkill`), always use the exact process name — never use wildcards or partial matches. Using wildcards risks terminating unrelated processes.
- Debug environment variables: when the user asks to add a debug switch for a specific feature, implement it as an `ONWARD_*` environment variable. Each variable controls exactly one concern, uses `1` to enable, is read once at startup, and logs a message when active. See `docs/debug-env-variables.md` for the full design, variable reference, and implementation guide.
- Hard rule — Cross-platform development (Windows / macOS / Linux):
    - Every new feature and bug fix must be designed and validated for all three platforms from the start. Do not implement for one platform first and "port later."
    - When creating a new feature or fixing a bug, always consider macOS, Linux, and Windows compatibility at the same time. This is a mandatory execution requirement, not an optional follow-up check.
    - The preferred design is three-platform independence: each platform's solution should be as decoupled as possible, without relying on another platform's behavior, tooling, path format, shell semantics, or fallback logic to work correctly.
    - If cross-platform dependency is truly unavoidable, the dependency must be isolated and made explicit with clear platform-specific branches or adapters (for example, `process.platform` dispatch, separate platform handlers, or clearly named platform conditionals). Do not hide cross-platform coupling inside shared implicit logic.
    - Platform-divergent areas require explicit per-platform branching (e.g., `process.platform` checks). The most error-prone areas, based on historical experience, include:
        1. **Git operations** (Git History, Git Diff): line-ending handling (`CRLF` vs `LF`), path separators (`\` vs `/`), shell escaping, locale-dependent output, and Git executable resolution differ significantly across platforms.
        2. **Terminal / shell operations**: default shell (`cmd.exe` / `powershell` vs `bash` / `zsh`), environment variable syntax (`%VAR%` vs `$VAR`), signal handling (`SIGTERM` vs `taskkill`), and PTY implementations vary.
        3. **File-system operations**: path length limits, case sensitivity, reserved filenames (`CON`, `NUL`, etc. on Windows), symlink behavior, and file-locking semantics.
    - When writing or reviewing platform-related code, always ask: "Will this behave correctly on the other two platforms?" If unsure, add explicit handling or at minimum a `TODO(cross-platform)` comment explaining the risk.
    - Automated tests that touch any of the above areas should include platform-specific assertions or be clearly marked as platform-conditional.
- Every task completion report must include:
    1. What is the task goal of the code, and what solution / design approach was used?
    2. What changes were made to which files?
    3. Finally, how do you evaluate this round of feature iteration? Is the repository change a very good / elegant design, or only a temporary patch-style solution?
    4. What would be a better follow-up improvement direction? Check whether any technical debt remains in the current repository?

## Release Channels and Tag Convention

The app supports two update channels with different tag formats and auto-update behavior:

| Channel | Tag format | Auto-check | Auto-download | Example |
|---------|-----------|------------|---------------|---------|
| **Daily** | `v2.1.0-daily.20260409.1` | Every hour | Yes | Production releases for all users |
| **Dev** | `v2.1.0-dev.20260409.1` | No | No | Development/debug builds, manual update only |

- **Hard rule**: Before pushing any tag that triggers a CI build, always ask the user which channel to target (daily or dev). Use the `/push-daily-build` skill which handles channel selection automatically.
- **Branch constraint (enforced by CI)**: Daily channel tags must be created from the `master` branch. The CI workflow will reject daily tags whose commit is not on master. Only Dev channel tags are allowed on non-master branches.
- Both channels produce full artifacts and publish manifests to gh-pages (under `updates/daily/` or `updates/dev/` respectively).
- Dev channel users see "Manual check required" in Settings and must click Check → Download → Restart manually.
- Daily channel users receive automatic background checks and downloads.

## Full Regression Testing

When the user asks for a full regression test (全量回归测试), refer to `test/full-regression-checklist.md` for the standard checklist, coverage scope, and validation steps.

## Lessons Learned

Before starting complex feature development, read `docs/lessons.md` for historical lessons learned to avoid repeating past mistakes.
