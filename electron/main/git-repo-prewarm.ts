/**
 * Repo prewarm coordinator (prewarm-on-cwd-switch architecture, decisions ⑥/⑦).
 *
 * Principle (user directive): every expensive git fork the UI would pay on
 * open — the Git Diff list + per-file content, the History list + commit diffs
 * — is done AHEAD of time, the moment the main process resolves a terminal's
 * cwd to a git repo. When the user later opens Diff / History the UI only READS
 * the warm caches; it never recomputes (except a genuine cache miss).
 *
 * Two triggers, two dedup scopes:
 *   - Diff (decision ⑥): warmed on the LEADING edge of `attachMirror` only
 *     (terminal subscribe cold start, or `cd` into a different repo), NEVER on
 *     `handleMirrorUpdate`. Deduped by `cwd` so the diff list + content warm
 *     exactly once per repo per session.
 *   - History (decision ⑦): warmed on attach AND whenever `branchOid` moves (a
 *     new commit / amend / checkout). Deduped by `cwd::branchOid`, so the
 *     coordinator can be pinged on every mirror-update cheaply — it is a no-op
 *     unless branchOid actually changed, which IS the "new commit → recompute
 *     the prewarm set" signal. History needs branchOid for its cache key, so a
 *     cold attach with no branchOid yet skips; the first mirror-update that
 *     carries branchOid warms it.
 *
 * Lanes: the diff-list warm runs in the worker's low-priority `::diff-precompute`
 * lane, the per-file content burst in `::precompute-burst`, and the History
 * prewarm in `::history-precompute` (see `git-ipc-worker-client-helpers.ts` and
 * the worker client), so a foreground enter never queues behind any prewarm.
 *
 * Dependency-injected so the dedup + orchestration logic is unit-testable in
 * plain node without an Electron build or a live worker.
