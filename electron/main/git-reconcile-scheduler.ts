/**
 * Git reconcile scheduler (pure logic).
 *
 * Unifies every "this repo's git status may be stale — recompute it" signal
 * into ONE dirty -> reconcile pipeline that runs IN PARALLEL with the
 * @parcel/watcher fast path and is NEVER gated on the watcher reporting an
 * error. This is the always-on safety net for the silent-watcher-failure
 * class: @parcel/watcher can stop delivering FSEvents with no error and no
 * callback (parcel-bundler/watcher#187), which leaves the task git badge
 * permanently stale until the user happens to focus the terminal. A real
 * production trace showed exactly this: the only mirror recompute in a 50-min
 * window was a `focus-resync`; zero `watcher-fire`, so a `docs/*.md` untracked
 * file sat green for ~5 hours.
 *
 * Design (per product spec):
 *   Dirty sources — all funnel here, in parallel with the watcher:
 *     - watcher file event (fast path)          -> markDirty('watcher')
 *     - tab switch: newly-visible git task      -> markDirty('tab-visible')
 *     - task activation / click                 -> markDirty('activate')
 *     - periodic heartbeat (always-on, tick()):
 *         focused task        -> reconcile every RECONCILE_FOCUSED_INTERVAL_MS (1 s)
 *         visible-unfocused   -> reconcile every RECONCILE_VISIBLE_INTERVAL_MS (3 s)
 *         hidden task         -> NO heartbeat (refreshed on tab-switch / activate)
 *
 *   Repo-keyed, not task-keyed: many tasks at the same repoRoot collapse to
 *   ONE git status; the repo's cadence is the FASTEST among its tasks
 *   (any focused -> 1 s, else any visible -> 3 s, else hidden -> heartbeat off).
 *
 * The watcher stays the fast path; this scheduler only decides WHEN a reconcile
 * is due. The actual git status + the per-repo in-flight/queued dedup and the
 * change-fingerprint short-circuit (a no-op reconcile emits nothing) live in
 * the mirror worker, so a heartbeat tick that finds no change is cheap.
 *
 * HOSTING (hard constraint H1, perf-critical): this scheduler AND the git status
 * it drives run inside the GitStateMirror WORKER thread, never the main thread —
 * the heartbeat timer and `git status` must stay off the main/render hot paths.
 * The main process (git-state-mirror-router) is forward-only: it relays renderer
 * focus / visibility / dirty signals to the worker and fans deltas back out, with
 * no git work and no reconcile timer of its own. The reconcile queue is keyed by
 * repoRoot so a repo runs at most one `git status` per cycle (min 1 s / max 3 s),
 * never back-to-back. See docs/git-status-reconcile-design.md.
 *
 * Pure + dependency-free so `test/unittest` loads it with no Electron build.
 * `now` is always injected (the scheduler never reads the clock) so unit tests
 * are deterministic and the logic is resume-safe.

// Adaptive backoff (per the "interval must exceed probe duration" principle —
// cf. Prometheus' scrape_timeout < scrape_interval rule). The heartbeat cadence
// above is a FIXED gap measured AFTER status completes, so the real period is
// `statusDuration + interval`. That silently assumes statusDuration << interval.
// On a host whose EDR/anti-malware minifilter taxes every `git.exe` spawn for
// SECONDS (a real trace measured `git status` at 1.3 s median / 12.9 s peak),
// the assumption inverts: a 1 s gap is far smaller than status' own latency, so
// the heartbeat fires back-to-back and saturates the spawn budget, starving the
// foreground Diff/precompute. The fix: stretch the effective gap to
// `lastDurationMs × factor` when status is slow, pinning the git-spawn duty
// cycle at ~1/(1+factor). On a normal host (status ~50 ms) `max(base, 50×4)`
// stays at the base 1 s/3 s — ZERO regression — so this only engages under load
// (which is exactly when freshness is already bounded by the slow status, and
// the watcher fast path still covers it).
