# Onward PowerShell shell integration. Loaded via `-NoExit -Command ". ..."`

# original prompt text is preserved and our OSC emission happens on every
# new prompt, matching VS Code's strategy.

    #      requires `/`). Without this the parser sees `file://HOSTC:\...`
    #      and reads back a malformed path that overwrites the OSC 633 cwd
    #      we just emitted with garbage.
    #   2. Percent-encode characters that are unsafe in a URI path — at minimum
    #      space → `%20`. We deliberately keep `:` (drive letter) and `/`
    #      readable; full RFC 3986 encoding is overkill for our parser.
    #   3. Insert a `/` between host and path so a Windows drive `C:\foo`
    #      becomes `file://localhost/C:/foo`, not `file://localhostC:/foo`.

    # that the interactive prompt machinery treats as a failed prompt, so
    # PowerShell discards the whole prompt (including the OSC writes below)
    # and falls back to the bare `PS>` prompt — emitting ZERO cwd OSC. The
    # renderer's xterm OSC parser then never fires and the Task status bar
    # never reflects `cd`. Keep this as `$hostName` (or any non-reserved name).
