# Push and Trigger Daily Build

Push local commits to `origin/master`, generate and confirm the release Change Log, create a versioned daily build tag, trigger GitHub Actions CI, and verify the full pipeline including GitHub Release artifacts and update manifests.

## User Input

The user may provide:

- **version** — The semver prefix for the tag (e.g., `2.1.0`, `2.2.0`, `3.0.0`). If omitted, detect the latest existing daily tag and reuse its version prefix.
- **date** — The date stamp (e.g., `20260405`). If omitted, use today's date in `YYYYMMDD` format.
- **sequence** — The sequence number (e.g., `1`, `2`). If omitted, auto-detect: find existing tags for the same version+date and increment. Default to `1` if none exist.

The resulting tag format depends on the chosen channel:
- **Daily**: `v{VERSION}-daily.{DATE}.{SEQ}` — e.g., `v2.1.0-daily.20260405.1`
- **Dev**: `v{VERSION}-dev.{DATE}.{SEQ}` — e.g., `v2.1.0-dev.20260405.1`

## Execution Flow

### Phase 0: Channel Selection

**Before any other action**, ask the user which channel to publish to:

> Which update channel should this build target?
> - **Daily** — Production release. All daily-channel users will receive this update automatically.
> - **Dev** — Development/debug build. Users must manually check and download. Use this for testing CI pipelines, auto-update flow debugging, or feature validation.

If the user says dev/debug/test, set `CHANNEL=dev`. The tag prefix becomes `-dev.` instead of `-daily.`.
If the user says daily/production/release (or doesn't specify), set `CHANNEL=daily`.

### Phase 1: Pre-flight Checks

```bash
# 1. Confirm current branch
git branch --show-current
# For daily channel: must be "master". If not, stop and warn the user.
# For dev channel: any branch is allowed. Inform the user of the current branch.

# 2. Check for uncommitted changes
git status --short
# If dirty, warn the user and ask whether to proceed.

# 3. Check if there are commits to push
git log origin/{BRANCH}..HEAD --oneline
# If no commits, inform the user — they may only want to create a tag on HEAD.
```

### Phase 2: Full Regression Test Gate (Daily channel only)

**Applies to the `daily` channel only.** Skip this phase entirely when `CHANNEL=dev`.

Before touching tags, commits, or CI, ask the user whether to run the full regression pass. The user must reply **explicitly** with one of the two literal answers — **"run"** or **"skip"**. Do not accept ambiguous, paraphrased, or implicit answers such as "yes", "ok", a thumbs-up, or silence. If the reply is anything else, ask again until one of the two literal answers is given.

Prompt to show the user verbatim:

> This is a **daily** build, which will be auto-delivered to all daily-channel users.
> Do you want to run the full regression test first?
>
> - Reply **"run"** to execute the full regression suite via `python3 test/autotest/run-full-regression.py`. The daily deploy will only continue after every script passes.
> - Reply **"skip"** to skip the regression gate and continue directly to Phase 3.

**If the user replies "run":**

1. Execute `python3 test/autotest/run-full-regression.py` from the repo root. That Python file is the single source of truth — runner list, per-script timeout, kill / cleanup contract, and output layout are all owned by it. Do not invoke individual `.sh` runners by hand or wrap them in a separate driver.
2. Output lands in `test/full-regression-results/<UTC-timestamp>/` (`summary.log`, `summary.json`, `logs/<suite>.log`). The orchestrator already prints PASS / FAIL per runner and a final summary; quote that summary verbatim back to the user.
3. The gate is considered **passed only when** the orchestrator's final summary reports `Failed: 0` and the per-script list contains no FAIL or TIMEOUT entries. The single skipped script is the Windows-only auto-update E2E, which must be run separately on Windows.
4. If any script fails, **stop immediately**. Report the failed script names, the aggregate log path (`test/full-regression-results/<ts>/summary.log`), and the individual per-script logs (`test/full-regression-results/<ts>/logs/<suite>.log`) to the user. Do **not** advance to Phase 3 until either:
   - The user fixes the failures, you rerun the gate, and every script passes; or
   - The user explicitly instructs you to skip the remaining gate and continue.
5. Once the gate passes, report the summary to the user and continue to Phase 3.

**If the user replies "skip":**

Acknowledge the decision, note in the session that the regression gate was skipped for this release, and continue to Phase 3 without running any regression scripts.

**Do not assume a default.** If the user has not yet answered with one of the two literal replies, wait — do not advance to Phase 3.

### Phase 3: Determine Tag

```bash
# Find the latest daily tag to detect the current version prefix
git tag -l "v*-daily.*" --sort=-version:refname | head -1

# Find existing tags for the target date to determine sequence number
git tag -l "v*-daily.{DATE}.*" --sort=-version:refname | head -1
```

If the user specified a version, use it. Otherwise, extract the version prefix from the latest daily tag (e.g., `2.1.0` from `v2.1.0-daily.20260402.1`).

If there are existing tags for the same version+date, increment the sequence number. Otherwise, start at `1`.

Present the resolved tag to the user for confirmation before proceeding:

> Channel: **{CHANNEL}**
> Tag to create: `v2.1.0-{CHANNEL}.20260405.1`
> Commits to push: 12
> Proceed?

### Phase 4: Generate Change Log Draft

Before any push, tag, or release action, generate the Change Log draft for the resolved tag:

```bash
node scripts/generate-changelog.js --tag {TAG}
```

This script writes the draft files:

- `resources/changelog/en/daily/{TAG}.md`
- `resources/changelog/index.json`
- derived HTML assets under `resources/changelog/html/**`

The draft is always written in English, based on the current `HEAD` diff against the previous Daily tag. It is only a starting point.
The HTML assets are generated automatically from the Markdown and should not be edited by hand.
Before showing the draft to the user, inspect the generated English Markdown and ensure every user-facing Change Log title, heading, bullet item, and sentence starts with an uppercase letter. Fix lowercase initial letters in the Markdown draft, then regenerate derived HTML assets if any Markdown content changed.

After generation, **stop and ask the user to review the draft**. Do not continue automatically.

Show the generated file paths and explicitly request confirmation:

> Change Log draft generated for `{TAG}`.
> Review the generated draft:
> - `resources/changelog/en/daily/{TAG}.md`
> Continue after confirmation?

Rules for this pause:

- The user must have a chance to edit the English draft before release.
- Do not push commits, create the tag, or publish anything before the user confirms.
- If the user requests edits, apply them first and re-show the final draft state.

### Phase 5: Commit Approved Change Log and Push

After the user confirms the draft, ensure the Change Log files are included in git history before tagging:

```bash
git status --short
git add resources/changelog
git commit -m "docs(changelog): add release notes for {TAG}"
```

Notes:

- The commit message must stay in English.
- If the user prefers to fold the Change Log into an existing unreleased commit, follow that instruction instead.
- If `git status --short` shows unexpected unrelated changes, stop and ask before committing them.

Then push local commits:

```bash
git push origin master
```

### Phase 6: Create and Push Tag

```bash
# Create and push the tag
git tag {TAG}
git push origin {TAG}
```

### Phase 7: Monitor CI Build

```bash
# Verify the workflow was triggered
gh run list --limit 1

# Get the run ID and watch it
gh run watch {RUN_ID} --exit-status
```

This step waits for the GitHub Actions workflow to complete. Typical duration is ~7 minutes. Use `--exit-status` so it returns non-zero on failure.

If the build fails, show the failing job logs:
```bash
gh run view {RUN_ID} --log-failed
```

### Phase 8: Verify Release Pipeline

After the build succeeds, verify all outputs:

```bash
# 1. GitHub Release exists and has artifacts
gh release view {TAG}

# 2. Manifests are updated (use the correct channel: daily or dev)
curl -s "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OPPO-PersonalAI/Onward/gh-pages/updates/{CHANNEL}/macos/arm64/latest.json"
curl -s "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OPPO-PersonalAI/Onward/gh-pages/updates/{CHANNEL}/macos/x64/latest.json"
curl -s "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OPPO-PersonalAI/Onward/gh-pages/updates/{CHANNEL}/windows/x64/latest.json"

# 3. Download links are accessible (expect HTTP 302)
curl -sI "{ARTIFACT_URL}" | head -3
```

Verify the following conditions:

| Check | Expected |
|---|---|
| GitHub Release title | `{CHANNEL_LABEL} {TAG}` (Daily Build or Dev Build) |
| Release assets | 6 files: macOS arm64 dmg+zip, macOS x64 dmg+zip, Windows x64 exe+zip |
| arm64 manifest version | Matches the tag version |
| x64 manifest version | Matches the tag version |
| windows manifest version | Matches the tag version |
| Artifact download URL | HTTP 302 (redirect to CDN) |

### Phase 9: Report

Present a summary table:

```
## Daily Build Release Complete

| Step | Status |
|---|---|
| Push code | {N} commits pushed |
| Create tag {TAG} | done |
| GitHub Actions build | arm64: Xm, x64: Xm |
| GitHub Release | 4 artifacts |
| Manifest update | arm64 + x64 |
| Download links | accessible |

Release URL: https://github.com/OPPO-PersonalAI/Onward/releases/tag/{TAG}
```

## Version Management

The version in the tag (e.g., `2.1.0`) is the **sole source of truth** for the app version in release builds. The build script `scripts/dist-release.js` reads `ONWARD_TAG` and overrides `package.json`'s version field at build time.

To bump the major version (e.g., from `2.1.0` to `2.2.0` or `3.0.0`), simply pass the new version when invoking this skill. No source files need to be modified.

The `package.json` version field (`2.0.1`) is only used for development builds and is independent of the release tag version.

## Error Handling

- **Not on master**: Stop immediately. Do not push or tag from other branches.
- **Dirty working tree**: Warn the user. They may want to commit first.
- **Regression gate unanswered (Daily)**: Stop. Do not advance to Phase 3 until the user replies with the literal "run" or "skip".
- **Regression gate failure (Daily)**: Stop before Phase 3. Surface the failing script names, the aggregate log path, and the relevant per-script logs under `/tmp`. Only proceed after a clean rerun or an explicit user override.
- **Change Log draft missing**: Stop. Generate `resources/changelog/**` first.
- **Change Log not yet confirmed**: Stop. Wait for explicit user approval before Phase 5.
- **Push fails**: Check network and authentication. Show the error.
- **Tag already exists**: Increment the sequence number or ask the user.
- **CI build fails**: Show failed job logs. Do not proceed to verification.
- **Manifest not updated**: The gh-pages push may have failed. Check the publish job logs.
